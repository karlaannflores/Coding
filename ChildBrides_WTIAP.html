    <h3>Why It's Problem</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="problemparagraphs ">
<h2>Education</h2>

<p>Child marriage often means the end of education for girls. It is closely linked to girls dropping out of school, denying children their right to the education they need for their personal development, their preparation for adulthood, and their ability to contribute to their family and community.
Out of school and in marriage, child brides are denied the ability to learn the skills that could help them earn an income and lift them and their children out of poverty. Married girls who would like to continue schooling may be both practically and legally excluded from doing so.
Child marriage is a major barrier to progress on girls’ education. Over sixty per cent of child brides in developing countries have had no formal education. Many girls aren’t in education because schools are inaccessible or expensive, because of the traditional role girls are expected to play in the household, or simply because parents don’t see the value of education for their daughters. Child marriage and a lack of education for girls are both underpinned by girls’ low status.</p>

<h2>Health</h2>

<p>Child marriage often has devastating consequences on a girl’s health. It encourages the initiation of sexual activity at an age when girls’ bodies are still developing and when they know little about their rights or their sexual and reproductive health.

Neither physically or emotionally ready to give birth, child brides face higher risks of death in childbirth and are particularly vulnerable to pregnancy-related injuries such as obstetric fistula.

Once married, girls face intense social pressure to prove their fertility. Often married to older husbands, it can be extremely difficult for girls to assert their wishes, particularly when it comes to negotiating safe sexual practices and the use of family planning methods.

As a result, they are more likely to experience frequent and early pregnancies, which may cause a range of long-term health complications and, in some cases, death.</p>

    <div class="problemparagraphs ">
<h2>Poverty</h2>

<p>Poverty is one of the main drivers of child marriage. Child brides are more likely to be poor and to remain poor.

Where poverty is acute, giving a daughter in marriage allows parents to reduce family expenses by ensuring they have one less person to feed, clothe and educate. In communities where economic transactions are integral to the marriage process, a dowry or ‘bride price’ is often welcome income for poor families.

Child marriage traps girls and their families in a cycle of poverty. Girls who marry young do not receive the educational and economic opportunities that help lift them and their families out of poverty and their children are more likely to undergo the same fate.</p>

<h2>Girls' Safety</h2>

<p>Child marriage puts women and girls at particular risk of sexual, physical and psychological violence throughout their lives. Girls who are married before 18 are more likely to experience domestic abuse than their unmarried peers and to report that their first sexual experience was forced. Early pregnancy and forced sexual initiation can affect the mental health of child brides for years after.

In areas where girls are at high risk of physical or sexual assault, some parents choose to marry off their daughter because they believe it will ensure her safety. These concerns are real; the dangers and risks that girls face in many countries are serious and numerous. But early marriage does not provide a safe alternative.

As minors, child brides are rarely able to assert their wishes to their much older husbands or negotiate safe and consensual sex. They are also more likely to believe that a man is sometimes justified in beating his wife than women who marry later.</p>

  <div class="problemparagraphs ">
<h2>Human Rights</h2>

<p>Child marriage is a serious human rights violation affecting children’s and women’s rights to health, education, equality, non-discrimination and to live free from violence and exploitation. These are rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), as well as other international and regional human rights instruments.

In some cases, child marriage could be considered slavery. When children are bought and sold under the guise of marriage for the purposes of sexual exploitation or when they are trafficked into forced marriages, their cases meet internationally recognised definitions of slavery or slavery-like practices.</p>
